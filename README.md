# web-dev-school
This repository contains web development projects I have completed for my Website Development class at Lawrence University. Projects are made using HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
As I am building my web design skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React through my course work I upload the assignments here. For the react assignments I have worked on I will just upload the necessary jsx files.
