            <p class = "cards">
                Skiing is a winter activity that uses two flat skis attached to the foot to glide across snow, usually down mountainsides
                or across flat traverses. Skiing has been around for millennia tracing back to Scandinavia between 3,000 and 4,000 BC and
                China around 8000 BC. The activity of skiing has many purposes originating as a mode of transportation across winter tundra,

           <p class = "cards">
                Snowboarding is a winter activity that uses a wide board connected to both of the riders feet, to descent a snowy hill or
                mountain. Snowboarding was first invented in America in the 1960s drawing inspiration from skateboarding and surfing.
                The sport, while having less history than skiing, quickly grew to popularity being a beloved past time in the winter, expecially
                in the 2000s. The most popular styles of snowboarding are:
